## 应收账款报告的规定


1. **Past Due Reporting-** Any insured account that has an outstanding balance over $10,000 **and** is 60 days past the invoice due date must to be reported on Allianz Trade Online by the 15th of the month. Past due accounts are reported one month in arrears. Failure to report a past due account may result in a decline on any future claims on the particular overdue account.

2. **Claim Process-** You have 180 days from supply date, or 150 days from the invoice due date to file a claim. The supply date is the date that your customer takes possession of your product. Missing the claim deadline results in us declining the claim. The collection process begins on the date the claim and all supporting documentation is accepted. Our collectors will work on your behalf to collect the outstanding balance. During this time **all communications with the debtor should cease**. Attempts to collect are made for 60 days. During this time if any monies are collected a **15%** fee will be applied to the collection amount.

3. **Disputes- We do not insure against disputes**. Once a debtor that you have filed a claim against raises a dispute on the delivered product (or rendered service), you will need to obtain an independent court settlement in your favor in order for us to pay the claim.

4. **Terms of Sale-** Your sales terms that we insure are 60 days. The terms on the invoices that you send to your customers must be equal to, or less than the terms we are giving. If you start selling on terms of sales that **exceed** the insured sales terms given, you will have to contact me and I will adjust this accordingly. An invoice that shows terms of sales greater than the insured terms of sales will not be insured under your current policy.

5. **Permitted limit fees-** Annual fees will be charged upon the renewal of your policy, **or for a requested increase**. You have a 60-day window from the original request date to submit an increase at no charge. Your fees are $55 for adding a domestic credit limit and $140 for adding an export credit limit.

6. **Final Sales Report / True-Up Premium-** At the end of your policy period, you will be asked to complete a final sales report. This report acts as a “self-audit” and confirms the actual amount of sales we have insured on your policy for the insured customers (under named cover, EZ cover and/or DCL). The current insured covered sales amount is $3,200,000. If you report a sales amount that is higher than the current covered sales amount we will charge an additional “True-Up” premium. There is no refund if the actual reported sales amount is below the covered sales amount.

7. **Self Service Portal**- Below is the link to Allianz Trade Online where you are able to request/adjust credit limits, report past dues, file claims, etc. If you have not yet logged on you can select “forgot password” and one will be sent to your email. Please let me know if you need any assistance navigating the site.
