To All,

  

Avalara has been contacting me to upgrade our contract from 3/6/2024 to 3/5/2025. It looks like we have used up all the transaction API calls in the original contract.

- Total Purchase Transaction: 100,000
    
- Total Transaction User:101,159
    

So, I have been working on getting a subscription update to 125,0000 transactions for our current contract. (I think it should be sufficient)
  
The final quote is $7,011.88 to upgrade our contract, and it is $0.28 per transaction which is cheaper than the usage charge of $0.517 per transaction 

So, there will be an additional $3,505.94 charge on the February & March Avalara Software payment( original at $6,338.68 per month).

The total monthly payment will be $9,844.62 and will we negotiate for a new contract next year beginning in March 2025

Attached is the contract I sign
