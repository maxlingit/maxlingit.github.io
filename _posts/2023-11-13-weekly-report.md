Hi Team,  
  
On the CNR Enterprises, Real Auction House matter, we researched local, experienced, established attorneys in small practices with an office near the Butler County Courthouse in Poplar Bluff, Missouri.  If you want to commence litigation against CNR, we believe that this would be the most cost-effective way to do so.  
  
Attorney Scott Dale of Dale Law Office ([https://www.scottddalelaw.com](https://www.scottddalelaw.com)) immediately returned my call and seemed interested in and well suited to handle this matter.  He was upfront with his fees ($250/hour) and retainer ($5,000).  He seems like a good fit for your needs ([https://www.scottddalelaw.com/about](https://www.scottddalelaw.com/about)).  
  
We recommend giving Scott a call about handling this matter, and you can mention that I already spoke with him.  If you want us to be on the call or forward the documents for this case to him, please let us know.  
  
I am waiting for a return call from another attorney and will update you if he seems like a better choice.  
  
Best regards,  
Kerry
