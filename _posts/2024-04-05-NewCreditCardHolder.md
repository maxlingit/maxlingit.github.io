Dear New Credit Card User:

We have set up a credit card for Karat home, so you can use the credit card for office expenses, travel, software subscriptions, and small incidental expenses.

The credit limit is 5000-10000. so I don't recommend using this card for large expenditures. Please email me for any additional credit limit.

Please see the attached credit card documentation policy and follow the instructions for expenditures and receipt collection. You can also visit:  [https://maxlingit.github.io/posts/CreditCardReceiptCollection/](https://maxlingit.github.io/posts/CreditCardReceiptCollection/) for your references

There are 2 tasks to finish your credit card setup.


1. I believe you should have received an email from "J.P. Morgan Commercial Card". Please follow the instructions to set up your online login.

2. the credit card will be mailed to your address at home. Please watch for the mail in the next 4-7 days.

	- Once you receive the card please make at least one transaction on the card to activate it
	
	-  if you run into an issue with card usage, customer services will require an access code

		1. Access Code 1: Last 4 SSN  
		    
		2. Access Code 2: Date of Month (DDMM)

Once You receive your credit card there are some help for resources for you to use the
